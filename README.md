Dijkstra's Algorithm for Finding Shortest Paths
This project implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest paths from a starting point to various charging stations within a graph. The graph is read from an edge list file, and the shortest paths are computed using the NetworkX library in Python.

Files:
1. network_edges_1.txt: Contains the edge list of the graph.
2. Final_project.py: Contains the implementation of the Dijkstra's Algorithm and the main execution script.

Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. NetworkX library
You can install the required library using pip: pip install networkx

Usage:
1. Place the network_edges_1.txt file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the Final_project.py script.
